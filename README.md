# HipPet

This project was mostly designed to mess around with node.js and xmpp protocols. It is still a work in progress
and current functionality just allows you to create a pet. (However saving and loading is near completion)

Basic Usage:

Insert jid and password of bot into config.js

Run using: node bot.js

Talk to the bot with the following commands:
'help' - launches the help guide
'new pet imp' - Creates a pet of the 'imp' type with random stats
